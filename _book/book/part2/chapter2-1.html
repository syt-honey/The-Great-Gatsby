                                <p>About half way between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land.</p>
<p>This is a valley of ashes &#x2014; a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens;</p>
<p>where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.</p>
<p>Occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest,</p>
<p>and immediately the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.</p>
<p>But above the gray land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.</p>
<p>The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic &#x2014; their irises are one yard high.</p>
<p>They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose.</p>
<p>Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away.</p>
<p>But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.</p>
<p>The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour.</p>
<p>There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan&#x2019;s mistress.</p>
<p>The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known.</p>
<p>His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew.</p>
<p>Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her &#x2014; but I did.</p>
<p>I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon, and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re getting off,&#x201D; he insisted.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want you to meet my girl.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I think he&#x2019;d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination to have my company bordered on violence.</p>
<p>The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.</p>
<p>I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg&#x2019;s persistent stare.</p>
<p>The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes;</p>
<p>the third was a garage &#x2014; Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold. &#x2014; and I followed Tom inside.</p>
<p>The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner.</p>
<p>It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste.</p>
<p>He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome.</p>
<p>When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hello, Wilson, old man,&#x201D; said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#x201C;How&#x2019;s business?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t complain,&#x201D; answered Wilson unconvincingly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When are you going to sell me that car?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Next week; I&#x2019;ve got my man working on it now.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Works pretty slow, don&#x2019;t he?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, he doesn&#x2019;t,&#x201D; said Tom coldly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And if you feel that way about it, maybe I&#x2019;d better sell it somewhere else after all.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t mean that,&#x201D; explained Wilson quickly. &#x201C;I just meant &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage.</p>
<p>Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door.</p>
<p>She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can.</p>
<p>Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty,</p>
<p>but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering.</p>
<p>She smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye.</p>
<p>Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Get some chairs, why don&#x2019;t you, so somebody can sit down.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, sure,&#x201D; agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls.</p>
<p>A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity &#x2014; except his wife, who moved close to Tom.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I want to see you,&#x201D; said Tom intently. &#x201C;Get on the next train.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;All right.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.</p>
<p>We waited for her down the road and out of sight.</p>
<p>It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a gray, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Terrible place, isn&#x2019;t it,&#x201D; said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Awful.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It does her good to get away.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t her husband object?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He&#x2019;s so dumb he doesn&#x2019;t know he&#x2019;s alive.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York &#x2014; or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car.</p>
<p>Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.</p>
<p>She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York.</p>
<p>At the news-stand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drug-store some cold cream and a small flask of perfume.</p>
<p>Up-stairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-colored with gray upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine.</p>
<p>But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.</p>
