                                <p>The coupe flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do I owe you?&#x201D; demanded Tom harshly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,&#x201D; remarked Wilson.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s why I want to get away. That&#x2019;s why I been bothering you about the car.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do I owe you?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Dollar twenty.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn&#x2019;t alighted on Tom.</p>
<p>He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick.</p>
<p>I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before &#x2014; and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.</p>
<p>Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty &#x2014; as if he had just got some poor girl with child.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll let you have that car,&#x201D; said Tom.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll send it over to-morrow afternoon.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind.</p>
<p>Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.</p>
<p>In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car.</p>
<p>So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture.</p>
<p>Her expression was curiously familiar &#x2014;</p>
<p>it was an expression I had often seen on women&#x2019;s faces, but on Myrtle Wilson&#x2019;s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.</p>
<p>There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic.</p>
<p>His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control.</p>
<p>Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind,</p>
<p>and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easy-going blue coupe.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,&#x201D; suggested Jordan.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I love New York on summer afternoons when every one&#x2019;s away. There&#x2019;s something very sensuous about it &#x2014; overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The word &#x201C;sensuous&#x201D; had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest the coupe came to a stop, and Daisy signaled us to draw up alongside.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Where are we going?&#x201D; she cried.</p>
<p>&#x201C;How about the movies?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s so hot,&#x201D; she complained.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You go. We&#x2019;ll ride around and meet you after.&#x201D;</p>
<p>With an effort her wit rose faintly, &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll meet you on some corner. I&#x2019;ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t argue about it here,&#x201D; Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight.</p>
<p>I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever.</p>
<p>But they didn&#x2019;t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.</p>
<p>The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me,</p>
<p>though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.</p>
<p>The notion originated with Daisy&#x2019;s suggestion that we hire five bath-rooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as &#x201C;a place to have a mint julep.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Each of us said over and over that it was a &#x201C;crazy idea.&#x201D;&#x2014; we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny.. ..</p>
<p>The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o&#x2019;clock, opening the windows admitted Only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park.</p>
<p>Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a swell suite,&#x201D; whispered Jordan respectfully, and every one laughed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Open another window,&#x201D; commanded Daisy, without turning around.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There aren&#x2019;t any more.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, we&#x2019;d better telephone for an axe &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The thing to do is to forget about the heat,&#x201D; said Tom impatiently.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why not let her alone, old sport?&#x201D; remarked Gatsby.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re the one that wanted to come to town.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, &#x201C;Excuse me.&#x201D;&#x2014; but this time no one laughed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll pick it up,&#x201D; I offered.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got it.&#x201D; Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered &#x201C;Hum!&#x201D; in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s a great expression of yours, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; said Tom sharply.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What is?&#x201D; &#x201C;All this &#x2018;old sport&#x2019; business. Where&#x2019;d you pick that up?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now see here, Tom,&#x201D; said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, &#x201C;if you&#x2019;re going to make personal remarks I won&#x2019;t stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn&#x2019;s Wedding March from the ballroom below.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!&#x201D; cried Jordan dismally.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Still &#x2014; I was married in the middle of June,&#x201D; Daisy remembered, &#x201C;Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Biloxi,&#x201D; he answered shortly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A man named Biloxi. &#x2018;blocks&#x2019; Biloxi, and he made boxes &#x2014; that&#x2019;s a fact &#x2014; and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;They carried him into my house,&#x201D; appended Jordan, &#x201C;because we lived just two doors from the church.</p>
<p>And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out.</p>
<p>The day after he left Daddy died.&#x201D;</p>
<p>After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, &#x201C;There wasn&#x2019;t any connection.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,&#x201D; I remarked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminum putter that I use to-day.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of &#x201C;Yea-ea-ea!&#x201D; and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re getting old,&#x201D; said Daisy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If we were young we&#x2019;d rise and dance.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Remember Biloxi,&#x201D; Jordan warned her.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Where&#x2019;d you know him, Tom?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Biloxi?&#x201D; He concentrated with an effort.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know him. He was a friend of Daisy&#x2019;s.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He was not,&#x201D; she denied.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Jordan smiled.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tom and I looked at each other blankly. &#x201C;Biloxi?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;First place, we didn&#x2019;t have any president &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>Gatsby&#x2019;s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you&#x2019;re an Oxford man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Not exactly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes &#x2014; I went there.&#x201D; A pause.</p>
<p>Then Tom&#x2019;s voice, incredulous and insulting: &#x201C;You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.&#x201D; Another pause.</p>
<p>A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but, the silence was unbroken by his &#x201C;thank you&#x201D; and the soft closing of the door.</p>
<p>This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I told you I went there,&#x201D; said Gatsby.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I heard you, but I&#x2019;d like to know when.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That&#x2019;s why I can&#x2019;t really call myself an Oxford man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief.</p>
<p>But we were all looking at Gatsby.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice,&#x201D; he continued.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We could go to any of the universities in England or France.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I wanted to get up and slap him on the back.</p>
<p>I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I&#x2019;d experienced before.</p>
