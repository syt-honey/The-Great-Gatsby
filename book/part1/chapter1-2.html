<p>There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air.</p>
<p>I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities,</p>
<p>and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew.</p>
<p>And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.</p>
<p>I was rather literary in college &#x2014; one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the &#x201C;Yale News.&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the &#x201C;well-rounded man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This isn&#x2019;t just an epigram &#x2014; life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.</p>
<p>It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America.</p>
<p>It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York &#x2014; and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land.</p>
<p>Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay,</p>
<p>jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.</p>
<p>They are not perfect ovals &#x2014; like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end &#x2014;</p>
<p>but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead.</p>
<p>To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.</p>
<p>I lived at West Egg, the &#x2014; well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them.</p>
<p>My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season.</p>
<p>The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard &#x2014;</p>
<p>it was a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden.</p>
<p>It was Gatsby&#x2019;s mansion.</p>
<p>Or, rather, as I didn&#x2019;t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name.</p>
<p>My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked,</p>
<p>so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor&#x2019;s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires &#x2014; all for eighty dollars a month.</p>
<p>Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans.</p>
<p>Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I&#x2019;d known Tom in college.</p>
<p>And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.</p>
<p>Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven &#x2014;</p>
<p>a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax.</p>
<p>His family were enormously wealthy &#x2014; even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach &#x2014;</p>
<p>but now he&#x2019;d left Chicago and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he&#x2019;d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.</p>
<p>It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.</p>
<p>Why they came East I don&#x2019;t know.</p>
<p>They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together.</p>
<p>This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn&#x2019;t believe it &#x2014;</p>
<p>I had no sight into Daisy&#x2019;s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.</p>
<p>And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all.</p>
<p>Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay.</p>
<p>The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens &#x2014;</p>
<p>finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run.</p>
<p>The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon,</p>
<p>and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.</p>
<p>He had changed since his New Haven years.</p>
<p>Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.</p>
<p>Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward.</p>
<p>Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body &#x2014;</p>
<p>he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat.</p>
<p>It was a body capable of enormous leverage &#x2014; a cruel body.</p>
<p>His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed.</p>
<p>There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked &#x2014; and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.</p>
