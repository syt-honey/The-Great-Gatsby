<p>Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her;</p>
<p>If you can bounce high, bounce for her too, Till she cry &#x2018;Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover, I must have you!&#x2019;&#x2014;THOMAS PARKE D&#x2019;INVILLIERS</p>
<p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I&#x2019;ve been turning over in my mind ever since.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,&#x201D; he told me, &#x201C;just remember that all the people in this world haven&#x2019;t had the advantages that you&#x2019;ve had.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He didn&#x2019;t say any more, but we&#x2019;ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.</p>
<p>In consequence, I&#x2019;m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.</p>
<p>The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person,</p>
<p>and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.</p>
<p>Most of the confidences were unsought &#x2014; frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon;</p>
<p>for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.</p>
<p>Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope.</p>
<p>I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested,</p>
<p>and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.</p>
<p>And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit.</p>
<p>Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don&#x2019;t care what it&#x2019;s founded on.</p>
<p>When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever;</p>
<p>I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart.</p>
<p>Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction &#x2014; Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn.</p>
<p>If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,</p>
<p>some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away.</p>
<p>This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the &#x201C;creative temperament.&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.</p>
<p>No &#x2014; Gatsby turned out all right at the end;</p>
<p>it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.</p>
<p>My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations.</p>
<p>The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we&#x2019;re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch,</p>
<p>but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather&#x2019;s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.</p>
<p>I never saw this great-uncle, but I&#x2019;m supposed to look like him &#x2014; with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father&#x2019;s office.</p>
<p>I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless.</p>
<p>Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe &#x2014; so I decided to go East and learn the bond business.</p>
<p>Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man.</p>
<p>All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, &#x201C;Why &#x2014; ye &#x2014; es,&#x201D; with very grave, hesitant faces.</p>
<p>Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.</p>
<p>The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees,</p>
<p>so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea.</p>
<p>He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone.</p>
<p>I had a dog &#x2014; at least I had him for a few days until he ran away &#x2014;</p>
<p>and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.</p>
<p>It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.</p>
<p>&#x201C;How do you get to West Egg village?&#x201D; he asked helplessly.</p>
<p>I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer.</p>
<p>I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler.</p>
<p>He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.</p>
