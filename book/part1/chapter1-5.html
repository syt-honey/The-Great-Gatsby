<p>Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning.</p>
<p>I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said &#x201C;Sh!&#x201D; in a warning voice.</p>
<p>A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear.</p>
<p>The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D; I said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t talk. I want to hear what happens.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Is something happening?&#x201D; I inquired innocently.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You mean to say you don&#x2019;t know?&#x201D; said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I thought everybody knew.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t.&#x201D; &#x201C;Why &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D; she said hesitantly, &#x201C;Tom&#x2019;s got some woman in New York.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Got some woman?&#x201D; I repeated blankly.</p>
<p>Miss Baker nodded.</p>
<p>&#x201C;She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. Don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It couldn&#x2019;t be helped!&#x201D; cried Daisy with tense gaiety.</p>
<p>She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: &#x201C;I looked outdoors for a minute, and it&#x2019;s very romantic outdoors.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line.</p>
<p>He&#x2019;s singing away &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D; Her voice sang: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s romantic, isn&#x2019;t it, Tom?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Very romantic,&#x201D; he said, and then miserably to me: &#x201C;If it&#x2019;s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables&#x201D;</p>
<p>The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air.</p>
<p>Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly,</p>
<p>and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes.</p>
<p>I couldn&#x2019;t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest&#x2019;s shrill metallic urgency out of mind.</p>
<p>To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing &#x2014; my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.</p>
<p>The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again.</p>
<p>Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library,</p>
<p>as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front.</p>
<p>In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.</p>
<p>Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk.</p>
<p>I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t know each other very well, Nick,&#x201D; she said suddenly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Even if we are cousins. You didn&#x2019;t come to my wedding.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t back from the war.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s true.&#x201D; She hesitated.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I&#x2019;m pretty cynical about everything.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Evidently she had reason to be.</p>
<p>I waited but she didn&#x2019;t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I suppose she talks, and &#x2014; eats, and everything.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, yes.&#x201D; She looked at me absently.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Very much.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;ll show you how I&#x2019;ve gotten to feel about &#x2014; things.</p>
<p>Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where.</p>
<p>I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl.</p>
<p>She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept.</p>
<p>&#x2018;all right,&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m glad it&#x2019;s a girl.</p>
<p>And I hope she&#x2019;ll be a fool &#x2014; that&#x2019;s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;You see I think everything&#x2019;s terrible anyhow,&#x201D; she went on in a convinced way.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Everybody thinks so &#x2014; the most advanced people. And I know.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom&#x2019;s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sophisticated &#x2014; God, I&#x2019;m sophisticated!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.</p>
<p>It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me.</p>
<p>I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.</p>
<p>Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light.</p>
<p>Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Post. &#x2014; the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune.</p>
<p>The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.</p>
