<p>I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she &#x201C;got done.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I enjoyed looking at her.</p>
<p>She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet.</p>
<p>Her gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face.</p>
<p>It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You live in West Egg,&#x201D; she remarked contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know somebody there.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know a single &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;You must know Gatsby.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Gatsby?&#x201D; demanded Daisy. &#x201C;What Gatsby?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced;</p>
<p>wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.</p>
<p>Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips,</p>
<p>the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why candles?&#x201D; objected Daisy, frowning.</p>
<p>She snapped them out with her fingers.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In two weeks it&#x2019;ll be the longest day in the year.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She looked at us all radiantly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it?</p>
<p>I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We ought to plan something,&#x201D; yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;All right,&#x201D; said Daisy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;ll we plan?&#x201D; She turned to me helplessly: &#x201C;What do people plan?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look!&#x201D; she complained; &#x201C;I hurt it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>We all looked &#x2014; the knuckle was black and blue.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You did it, Tom,&#x201D; she said accusingly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know you didn&#x2019;t mean to, but you did do it.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a &#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I hate that word hulking,&#x201D; objected Tom crossly, &#x201C;even in kidding.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hulking,&#x201D; insisted Daisy.</p>
<p>Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter,</p>
<p>that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire.</p>
<p>They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained.</p>
<p>They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away.</p>
<p>It was sharply different from the West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,&#x201D; I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Can&#x2019;t you talk about crops or something?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Civilization&#x2019;s going to pieces,&#x201D; broke out Tom violently.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things.</p>
<p>Have you read &#x2018;The Rise of the Colored Empires&#x2019; by this man Goddard?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why, no,&#x201D; I answered, rather surprised by his tone.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, it&#x2019;s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it.</p>
<p>The idea is if we don&#x2019;t look out the white race will be &#x2014; will be utterly submerged.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s all scientific stuff; it&#x2019;s been proved.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Tom&#x2019;s getting very profound,&#x201D; said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He reads deep books with long words in them.</p>
<p>What was that word we &#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, these books are all scientific,&#x201D; insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This fellow has worked out the whole thing.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve got to beat them down,&#x201D; whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You ought to live in California &#x2014;&#x201D; began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This idea is that we&#x2019;re Nordics.</p>
<p>I am, and you are, and you are, and &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2014; And we&#x2019;ve produced all the things that go to make civilization &#x2014; oh, science and art, and all that. Do you see?&#x201D;</p>
<p>There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.</p>
<p>When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll tell you a family secret,&#x201D; she whispered enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s about the butler&#x2019;s nose.</p>
<p>Do you want to hear about the butler&#x2019;s nose?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s why I came over to-night.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, he wasn&#x2019;t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people.</p>
<p>He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Things went from bad to worse,&#x201D; suggested Miss Baker.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened &#x2014;</p>
<p>then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.</p>
<p>The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom&#x2019;s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside.</p>
<p>As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I love to see you at my table, Nick.</p>
<p>You remind me of a &#x2014; of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn&#x2019;t he?&#x201D;</p>
<p>She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation: &#x201C;An absolute rose?&#x201D;</p>
<p>This was untrue.</p>
<p>I am not even faintly like a rose.</p>
<p>She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words.</p>
<p>Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.</p>
