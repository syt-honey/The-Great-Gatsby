<p>In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What kind are they?&#x201D; asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.</p>
<p>&#x201C;All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;d like to get one of those police dogs; I don&#x2019;t suppose you got that kind?&#x201D;</p>
<p>The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s no police dog,&#x201D; said Tom.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, it&#x2019;s not exactly a police dog,&#x201D; said the man with disappointment in his voice.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s more of an Airedale.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He passed his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look at that coat. Some coat. That&#x2019;s a dog that&#x2019;ll never bother you with catching cold.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s cute,&#x201D; said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. &#x201C;How much is it?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;That dog?&#x201D; He looked at it admiringly. &#x201C;That dog will cost you ten dollars.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Airedale &#x2014; undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white &#x2014;</p>
<p>changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson&#x2019;s lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Is it a boy or a girl?&#x201D; she asked delicately.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That dog? That dog&#x2019;s a boy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a bitch,&#x201D; said Tom decisively.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Here&#x2019;s your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hold on,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;I have to leave you here.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, you don&#x2019;t,&#x201D; interposed Tom quickly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Myrtle&#x2019;ll be hurt if you don&#x2019;t come up to the apartment. Won&#x2019;t you, Myrtle?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come on,&#x201D; she urged.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll telephone my sister Catherine. She&#x2019;s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, I&#x2019;d like to, but &#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.</p>
<p>At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses.</p>
<p>Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to have the McKees come up,&#x201D; she announced as we rose in the elevator.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The apartment was on the top floor &#x2014; a small living-room, a small dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath.</p>
<p>The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it,</p>
<p>so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles.</p>
<p>The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.</p>
<p>Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room.</p>
<p>Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog.</p>
<p>A reluctant elevator-boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog-biscuits &#x2014;</p>
<p>one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door.</p>
<p>I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon;</p>
<p>so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it, although until after eight o&#x2019;clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun.</p>
<p>Sitting on Tom&#x2019;s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner.</p>
<p>When I came back they had disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter &#x2014;</p>
<p>either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted things, because it didn&#x2019;t make any sense to me.</p>
<p>Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment-door.</p>
<p>The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white.</p>
<p>Her eye-brows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face.</p>
<p>When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms.</p>
<p>She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here.</p>
<p>But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.</p>
<p>Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below.</p>
<p>He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in his greeting to every one in the room.</p>
<p>He informed me that he was in the &#x201C;artistic game,&#x201D; and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson&#x2019;s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall.</p>
<p>His wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible.</p>
<p>She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-colored chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room.</p>
<p>With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change.</p>
<p>The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur.</p>
<p>Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment,</p>
<p>and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My dear,&#x201D; she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, &#x201C;most of these fellas will cheat you every time.</p>
<p>All they think of is money.</p>
<p>I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you&#x2019;d of thought she had my appendicitis out.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What was the name of the woman?&#x201D; asked Mrs. McKee.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people&#x2019;s feet in their own homes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I like your dress,&#x201D; remarked Mrs. McKee, &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s adorable.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s just a crazy old thing,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I just slip it on sometimes when I don&#x2019;t care what I look like.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,&#x201D; pursued Mrs. McKee.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile.</p>
<p>Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I should change the light,&#x201D; he said after a moment.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;d like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I&#x2019;d try to get hold of all the back hair.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t think of changing the light,&#x201D; cried Mrs. McKee. &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s &#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>Her husband said &#x201C;sh!&#x201D; and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You McKees have something to drink,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I told that boy about the ice.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders.</p>
<p>&#x201C;These people! You have to keep after them all the time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She looked at me and laughed pointlessly.</p>
<p>Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve done some nice things out on Long Island,&#x201D; asserted Mr. McKee.</p>
<p>Tom looked at him blankly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Two of them we have framed down-stairs.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Two what?&#x201D; demanded Tom.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point&#x2014; The Gulls, and the other I call Montauk Point&#x2014; The Sea.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do you live down on Long Island, too?&#x201D; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I live at West Egg.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago.</p>
<p>At a man named Gatsby&#x2019;s. Do you know him?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I live next door to him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, they say he&#x2019;s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm&#x2019;s. That&#x2019;s where all his money comes from.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Really?&#x201D; She nodded. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m scared of him. I&#x2019;d hate to have him get anything on me.&#x201D;</p>
