                                <p>This absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by Mrs. McKee&#x2019;s pointing suddenly at Catherine:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Chester, I think you could do something with her,&#x201D; she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ask Myrtle,&#x201D; said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray.</p>
<p>&#x201C;She&#x2019;ll give you a letter of introduction, won&#x2019;t you Myrtle?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do what?&#x201D; she asked, startled.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented.</p>
<p>&#x201C;George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump, or something like that.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: &#x201C;Neither of them can stand the person they&#x2019;re married to.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Can&#x2019;t they?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Can&#x2019;t stand them.&#x201D; She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What I say is, why go on living with them if they can&#x2019;t stand them?</p>
<p>If I was them I&#x2019;d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t she like Wilson either?&#x201D;</p>
<p>The answer to this was unexpected.</p>
<p>It came from Myrtle, who had overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You see,&#x201D; cried Catherine triumphantly.</p>
<p>She lowered her voice again.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s really his wife that&#x2019;s keeping them apart. She&#x2019;s a Catholic, and they don&#x2019;t believe in divorce.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When they do get married,&#x201D; continued Catherine, &#x201C;they&#x2019;re going West to live for a while until it blows over.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;d be more discreet to go to Europe.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, do you like Europe?&#x201D; she exclaimed surprisingly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I just got back from Monte Carlo.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Really.&#x201D; &#x201C;Just last year. I went over there with another girl.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stay long?&#x201D; &#x201C;No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back.</p>
<p>We went by way of Marseilles.</p>
<p>We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gypped out of it all in two days in the private rooms.</p>
<p>We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you.</p>
<p>God, how I hated that town!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean &#x2014; then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I almost made a mistake, too,&#x201D; she declared vigorously.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I almost married a little kyke who&#x2019;d been after me for years. I knew he was below me.</p>
<p>Everybody kept saying to me: &#x2018;Lucille, that man&#x2019;s &#x2018;way below you!&#x2019;</p>
<p>But if I hadn&#x2019;t met Chester, he&#x2019;d of got me sure.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes, but listen,&#x201D; said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, &#x201C;at least you didn&#x2019;t marry him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know I didn&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, I married him,&#x201D; said Myrtle, ambiguously.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And that&#x2019;s the difference between your case and mine.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why did you, Myrtle?&#x201D; demanded Catherine. &#x201C;Nobody forced you to.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Myrtle considered.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,&#x201D; she said finally.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn&#x2019;t fit to lick my shoe.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;You were crazy about him for a while,&#x201D; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Crazy about him!&#x201D; cried Myrtle incredulously.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly.</p>
<p>I tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The only crazy I was was when I married him.</p>
<p>I knew right away I made a mistake.</p>
<p>He borrowed somebody&#x2019;s best suit to get married in, and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out.</p>
<p>&#x2018;oh, is that your suit?&#x2019; I said.</p>
<p>&#x2018;this is the first I ever heard about it.&#x2019;</p>
<p>But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;She really ought to get away from him,&#x201D; resumed Catherine to me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;ve been living over that garage for eleven years. And tom&#x2019;s the first sweetie she ever had.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The bottle of whiskey &#x2014; a second one &#x2014; was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine, who &#x201C;felt just as good on nothing at all.</p>
<p>Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves.</p>
<p>I wanted to get out and walk southward toward the park through the soft twilight,</p>
<p>but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair.</p>
<p>Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering.</p>
<p>I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.</p>
<p>Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train.</p>
<p>I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night.</p>
<p>He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes, and I couldn&#x2019;t keep my eyes off him,</p>
<p>but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head.</p>
<p>When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirt-front pressed against my arm, and so I told him I&#x2019;d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied.</p>
<p>I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn&#x2019;t hardly know I wasn&#x2019;t getting into a subway train.</p>
<p>All I kept thinking about, over and over, was &#x2018;You can&#x2019;t live forever; you can&#x2019;t live forever.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My dear,&#x201D; she cried, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to give you this dress as soon as I&#x2019;m through with it.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve got to get another one to-morrow.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m going to make a list of all the things I&#x2019;ve got to get.</p>
<p>A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother&#x2019;s grave that&#x2019;ll last all summer.</p>
<p>I got to write down a list so I won&#x2019;t forget all the things I got to do.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It was nine o&#x2019;clock &#x2014; almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten.</p>
<p>Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action.</p>
<p>Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.</p>
<p>The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly.</p>
<p>People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away.</p>
<p>Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy&#x2019;s name.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!&#x201D; shouted Mrs. Wilson. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll say it whenever I want to! Daisy! Dai &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand.</p>
<p>Then there were bloody towels upon the bath-room floor, and women&#x2019;s voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain.</p>
<p>Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door.</p>
<p>When he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene &#x2014;</p>
<p>his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid,</p>
<p>and the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of Versailles.</p>
<p>Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door.</p>
<p>Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come to lunch some day,&#x201D; he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Where?&#x201D; &#x201C;Anywhere.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Keep your hands off the lever,&#x201D; snapped the elevator boy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I beg your pardon,&#x201D; said Mr. McKee with dignity, &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know I was touching it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;All right,&#x201D; I agreed, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be glad to.&#x201D;. . .</p>
<p>I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old Grocery Horse . . . Brook&#x2019;n Bridge. . . . &#x201D;</p>
<p>Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for the four o&#x2019;clock train.</p>
