                                <p>We went up-stairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,</p>
<p>and bathrooms with sunken baths &#x2014; intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Klipspringer, the &#x201C;boarder.&#x201D; I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning.</p>
<p>Finally we came to Gatsby&#x2019;s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.</p>
<p>He hadn&#x2019;t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.</p>
<p>Sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real.</p>
<p>Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs.</p>
<p>His bedroom was the simplest room of all &#x2014; except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold.</p>
<p>Daisy took the brush with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s the funniest thing, old sport,&#x201D; he said hilariously.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t &#x2014; When I try to &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third.</p>
<p>After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence.</p>
<p>He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity.</p>
<p>Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock.</p>
<p>Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one, before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel, which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray.</p>
<p>While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher &#x2014; shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, and monograms of Indian blue.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.</p>
<p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re such beautiful shirts,&#x201D; she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It makes me sad because I&#x2019;ve never seen such &#x2014; such beautiful shirts before.&#x201D;</p>
<p>After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming-pool, and the hydroplane and the mid-summer flowers &#x2014; but outside Gatsby&#x2019;s window it began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If it wasn&#x2019;t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,&#x201D; said Gatsby.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said.</p>
<p>Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever.</p>
<p>Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her.</p>
<p>It had seemed as close as a star to the moon.</p>
<p>Now it was again a green light on a dock.</p>
<p>His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.</p>
<p>I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness.</p>
<p>A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who&#x2019;s this?&#x201D; &#x201C;That? That&#x2019;s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The name sounded faintly familiar.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau &#x2014; Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly &#x2014; taken apparently when he was about eighteen.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I adore it,&#x201D; exclaimed Daisy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour &#x2014; or a yacht.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look at this,&#x201D; said Gatsby quickly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Here&#x2019;s a lot of clippings &#x2014; about you.&#x201D; They stood side by side examining it.</p>
<p>I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes. . . . well, I can&#x2019;t talk now. . . . I can&#x2019;t talk now, old sport. . . . I said a small town. . . . he must know what a small town is. . . . well, he&#x2019;s no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town. . . . &#x201D;</p>
<p>He rang off.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come here quick!&#x201D; cried Daisy at the window.</p>
<p>The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look at that,&#x201D; she whispered, and then after a moment: &#x201C;I&#x2019;d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I tried to go then, but they wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know what we&#x2019;ll do,&#x201D; said Gatsby, &#x201C;we&#x2019;ll have Klipspringer play the piano.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He went out of the room calling &#x201C;Ewing!&#x201D; and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair.</p>
<p>He was now decently clothed in a &#x201C;sport shirt,&#x201D; open at the neck, sneakers, and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Did we interrupt your exercises?&#x201D; inquired Daisy politely.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was asleep,&#x201D; cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. &#x201C;That is, I&#x2019;d been asleep. Then I got up.. ..&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Klipspringer plays the piano,&#x201D; said Gatsby, cutting him off. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you, Ewing, old sport?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t play well. I don&#x2019;t &#x2014; I hardly play at all. I&#x2019;m all out of prac &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll go down-stairs,&#x201D; interrupted Gatsby.</p>
<p>He flipped a switch. The gray windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.</p>
<p>In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano.</p>
<p>He lit Daisy&#x2019;s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.</p>
<p>When Klipspringer had played The Love Nest, he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn&#x2019;t play. I&#x2019;m all out of prac &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t talk so much, old sport,&#x201D; commanded Gatsby. &#x201C;Play!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;In the morning, In the evening, Ain&#x2019;t we got fun&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound.</p>
<p>All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York.</p>
<p>It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.</p>
<p>&#x201C;One thing&#x2019;s sure and nothing&#x2019;s surer The rich get richer and the poor get&#x2014; children. In the meantime, In between time&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>As I went over to say good-by I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby&#x2019;s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness.</p>
<p>Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams &#x2014; not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion.</p>
<p>It had gone beyond her, beyond everything.</p>
<p>He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way.</p>
<p>No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.</p>
<p>As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly.</p>
<p>His hand took hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion.</p>
<p>I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn&#x2019;t be over-dreamed &#x2014; that voice was a deathless song.</p>
<p>They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn&#x2019;t know me now at all.</p>
<p>I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life.</p>
<p>Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.</p>
