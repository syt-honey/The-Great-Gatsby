                                <p>Then I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire.</p>
<p>Two o&#x2019;clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires.</p>
<p>Turning a corner, I saw that it was Gatsby&#x2019;s house, lit from tower to cellar.</p>
<p>At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into &#x201C;hide-and-go-seek&#x201D; or &#x201C;sardines-in-the-box&#x201D; with all the house thrown open to the game.</p>
<p>But there wasn&#x2019;t a sound.</p>
<p>Only wind in the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness.</p>
<p>As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Your place looks like the World&#x2019;s Fair,&#x201D; I said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Does it?&#x201D; He turned his eyes toward it absently.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let&#x2019;s go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s too late.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming-pool? I haven&#x2019;t made use of it all summer.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got to go to bed.&#x201D; &#x201C;All right.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I talked with Miss Baker,&#x201D; I said after a moment.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to call up Daisy to-morrow and invite her over here to tea.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, that&#x2019;s all right,&#x201D; he said carelessly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to put you to any trouble.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What day would suit you?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What day would suit you?&#x201D; he corrected me quickly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to put you to any trouble, you see.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;How about the day after to-morrow?&#x201D; He considered for a moment.</p>
<p>Then, with reluctance:&#x201C;I want to get the grass cut,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>We both looked at the grass &#x2014; there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began.</p>
<p>I suspected that he meant my grass.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s another little thing,&#x201D; he said uncertainly, and hesitated.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Would you rather put it off for a few days?&#x201D; I asked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, it isn&#x2019;t about that. At least &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D; He fumbled with a series of beginnings.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why, I thought &#x2014; why, look here, old sport, you don&#x2019;t make much money, do you?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Not very much.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I thought you didn&#x2019;t, if you&#x2019;ll pardon my &#x2014; You see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand.</p>
<p>And I thought that if you don&#x2019;t make very much &#x2014; You&#x2019;re selling bonds, aren&#x2019;t you, old sport?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Trying to.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, this would interest you. It wouldn&#x2019;t take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life.</p>
<p>But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got my hands full,&#x201D; I said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m much obliged but I couldn&#x2019;t take on any more work.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;You wouldn&#x2019;t have to do any business with Wolfsheim.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the &#x201C;gonnegtion&#x201D; mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong.</p>
<p>He waited a moment longer, hoping I&#x2019;d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.</p>
<p>The evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door.</p>
<p>So I didn&#x2019;t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he &#x201C;glanced into rooms&#x201D; while his house blazed gaudily on.</p>
<p>I called up Daisy from the office next morning, and invited her to come to tea.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t bring Tom,&#x201D; I warned her. &#x201C;What?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t bring Tom.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who is &#x2018;Tom&#x2019;?&#x201D; she asked innocently.</p>
<p>The day agreed upon was pouring rain.</p>
<p>At eleven o&#x2019;clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass.</p>
<p>This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy, whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.</p>
<p>The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o&#x2019;clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby&#x2019;s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it.</p>
<p>An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby, in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, hurried in.</p>
<p>He was pale, and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Is everything all right?&#x201D; he asked immediately.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The grass looks fine, if that&#x2019;s what you mean.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What grass?&#x201D; he inquired blankly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, the grass in the yard.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don&#x2019;t believe he saw a thing.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Looks very good,&#x201D; he remarked vaguely.</p>
<p>&#x201C;One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was the Journal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of &#x2014; of tea?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn.</p>
<p>Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Will they do?&#x201D; I asked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Of course, of course! They&#x2019;re fine!&#x201D; and he added hollowly, &#x201C; . . . old sport.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which occasional thin drops swam like dew.</p>
<p>Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay&#x2019;s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor, and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside.</p>
<p>Finally he got up and informed me, in an uncertain voice, that he was going home.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why&#x2019;s that?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Nobody&#x2019;s coming to tea. It&#x2019;s too late!&#x201D;</p>
<p>He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t wait all day.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be silly; it&#x2019;s just two minutes to four.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane.</p>
<p>We both jumped up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.</p>
<p>Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the drive. It stopped.</p>
<p>Daisy&#x2019;s face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?&#x201D;</p>
<p>The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain.</p>
<p>I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone, before any words came through.</p>
<p>A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Are you in love with me,&#x201D; she said low in my ear, &#x201C;or why did I have to come alone?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come back in an hour, Ferdie.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then in a grave murmur:&#x201C;His name is Ferdie&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Does the gasoline affect his nose?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201D; she said innocently. &#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</p>
<p>We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, that&#x2019;s funny,&#x201D; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s funny?&#x201D; She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door.</p>
<p>I went out and opened it.</p>
<p>Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.</p>
<p>With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the living-room.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x2019;t a bit funny.</p>
<p>Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.</p>
<p>For half a minute there wasn&#x2019;t a sound.</p>
<p>Then from the living-room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy&#x2019;s voice on a clear artificial note: &#x201C;I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A pause; it endured horribly.</p>
<p>I had nothing to do in the hall, so I went into the room.</p>
