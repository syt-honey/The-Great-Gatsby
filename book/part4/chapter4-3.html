                                <p>A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfsheim, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy.</p>
<p>His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room &#x2014; he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind.</p>
<p>I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look here, old sport,&#x201D; said Gatsby, leaning toward me, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.&#x201D;</p>
<p>There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like mysteries,&#x201D; I answered.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And I don&#x2019;t understand why you won&#x2019;t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, it&#x2019;s nothing underhand,&#x201D; he assured me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Miss Baker&#x2019;s a great sportswoman, you know, and she&#x2019;d never do anything that wasn&#x2019;t all right.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfsheim at the table.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He has to telephone,&#x201D; said Mr. Wolfsheim, following him with his eyes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Fine fellow, isn&#x2019;t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; &#x201C;He&#x2019;s an Oggsford man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh!&#x201D; &#x201C;He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve heard of it.&#x201D; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s one of the most famous colleges in the world.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Have you known Gatsby for a long time?&#x201D; I inquired.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Several years,&#x201D; he answered in a gratified way.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war.</p>
<p>But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour.</p>
<p>I said to myself: &#x2018;There&#x2019;s the kind of man you&#x2019;d like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.&#x2019;.&#x201D; He paused.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I see you&#x2019;re looking at my cuff buttons.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I hadn&#x2019;t been looking at them, but I did now.</p>
<p>They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Finest specimens of human molars,&#x201D; he informed me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well!&#x201D; I inspected them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s a very interesting idea.&#x201D; &#x201C;Yeah.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He flipped his sleeves up under his coat.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yeah, Gatsby&#x2019;s very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend&#x2019;s wife.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfsheim drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have enjoyed my lunch,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;and I&#x2019;m going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t hurry, Meyer,&#x201D; said Gatsby, without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolfsheim raised his hand in a sort of benediction.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re very polite, but I belong to another generation,&#x201D; he announced solemnly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won&#x2019;t impose myself on you any longer.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling.</p>
<p>I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He becomes very sentimental sometimes,&#x201D; explained Gatsby.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is one of his sentimental days. He&#x2019;s quite a character around New York &#x2014; a denizen of Broadway.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who is he, anyhow, an actor?&#x201D;&#x201C;No.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;A dentist?&#x201D; &#x201C;Meyer Wolfsheim? No, he&#x2019;s a gambler.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly: &#x201C;He&#x2019;s the man who fixed the World&#x2019;s Series back in 1919.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Fixed the World&#x2019;s Series?&#x201D; I repeated.</p>
<p>The idea staggered me.</p>
<p>I remembered, of course, that the World&#x2019;s Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable chain.</p>
<p>It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people &#x2014; with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.</p>
<p>&#x201C;How did he happen to do that?&#x201D; I asked after a minute.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He just saw the opportunity.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why isn&#x2019;t he in jail?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;They can&#x2019;t get him, old sport. He&#x2019;s a smart man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I insisted on paying the check.</p>
<p>As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come along with me for a minute,&#x201D; I said; &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got to say hello to some one.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Where&#x2019;ve you been?&#x201D; he demanded eagerly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Daisy&#x2019;s furious because you haven&#x2019;t called up.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.&#x201D;</p>
<p>They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby&#x2019;s face.</p>
<p>&#x201C;How&#x2019;ve you been, anyhow?&#x201D; demanded Tom of me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;How&#x2019;d you happen to come up this far to eat?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.</p>
<p>One October day in nineteen-seventeen &#x2014;&#x2014; (said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns.</p>
<p>I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground.</p>
<p>I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way.</p>
<p>The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay&#x2019;s house.</p>
<p>She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville.</p>
<p>She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Anyways, for an hour!&#x201D;</p>
<p>When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before.</p>
<p>They were so engrossed in each other that she didn&#x2019;t see me until I was five feet away.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hello, Jordan,&#x201D; she called unexpectedly. &#x201C;Please come here.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most.</p>
<p>She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was.</p>
<p>Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn&#x2019;t come that day?</p>
<p>The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since.</p>
<p>His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn&#x2019;t lay eyes on him again for over four years &#x2014; even after I&#x2019;d met him on Long Island I didn&#x2019;t realize it was the same man.</p>
<p>That was nineteen-seventeen.</p>
<p>By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn&#x2019;t see Daisy very often.</p>
<p>She went with a slightly older crowd &#x2014; when she went with anyone at all.</p>
<p>Wild rumors were circulating about her &#x2014; how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say good-by to a soldier who was going overseas.</p>
<p>She was effectually prevented, but she wasn&#x2019;t on speaking terms with her family for several weeks.</p>
<p>After that she didn&#x2019;t play around with the soldiers any more, but only with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town, who couldn&#x2019;t get into the army at all.</p>
