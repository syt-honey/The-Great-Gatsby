                                <p>The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfsheim; I couldn&#x2019;t seem to reach him any other way. </p>
<p>The door that I pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked &#x201C;The Swastika Holding Company,&#x201D; and at first there didn&#x2019;t seem to be any one inside. </p>
<p>But when I&#x2019;d shouted &#x201C;hello&#x201D; several times in vain, an argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Nobody&#x2019;s in,&#x201D; she said. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Mr. Wolfsheim&#x2019;s gone to Chicago.&#x201D; </p>
<p>The first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to whistle &#x201C;The Rosary,&#x201D; tunelessly, inside. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.&#x201D; </p>
<p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t get him back from Chicago, can I?&#x201D; </p>
<p>At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfsheim&#x2019;s, called &#x201C;Stella!&#x201D; from the other side of the door. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Leave your name on the desk,&#x201D; she said quickly. </p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll give it to him when he gets back.&#x201D; </p>
<p>&#x201C;But I know he&#x2019;s there.&#x201D; </p>
<p>She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips. </p>
<p>&#x201C;You young men think you can force your way in here any time,&#x201D; she scolded. </p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re getting sickantired of it. When I say he&#x2019;s in Chicago, he&#x2019;s in Chicago.&#x201D; </p>
<p>I mentioned Gatsby. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh &#x2014; h!&#x201D; She looked at me over again. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Will you just &#x2014; What was your name?&#x201D; </p>
<p>She vanished. </p>
<p>In a moment Meyer Wolfsheim stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands. </p>
<p>He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar. </p>
<p>&#x201C;My memory goes back to when I first met him,&#x201D; he said. </p>
<p>&#x201C;A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war. </p>
<p>He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn&#x2019;t buy some regular clothes. </p>
<p>First time I saw him was when he come into Winebrenner&#x2019;s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job. </p>
<p>He hadn&#x2019;t eat anything for a couple of days. </p>
<p>&#x2018;come on have some lunch with me,&#x2019; I said. </p>
<p>He ate more than four dollars&#x2019; worth of food in half an hour.&#x201D; </p>
<p>&#x201C;Did you start him in business?&#x201D; I inquired. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Start him! I made him.&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh.&#x201D; </p>
<p>&#x201C;I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. </p>
<p>I saw right away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. </p>
<p>I got him to join up in the American Legion and he used to stand high there. </p>
<p>Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany. </p>
<p>We were so thick like that in everything.&#x201D;&#x2014; he held up two bulbous fingers &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D; always together.&#x201D; </p>
<p>I wondered if this partnership had included the World&#x2019;s Series transaction in 1919. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Now he&#x2019;s dead,&#x201D; I said after a moment. </p>
<p>&#x201C;You were his closest friend, so I know you&#x2019;ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.&#x201D; </p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;d like to come.&#x201D; </p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, come then.&#x201D; </p>
<p>The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears. </p>
<p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t do it &#x2014; I can&#x2019;t get mixed up in it,&#x201D; he said. </p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing to get mixed up in. It&#x2019;s all over now.&#x201D; </p>
<p>&#x201C;When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out. </p>
<p>When I was a young man it was different &#x2014; if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. </p>
<p>You may think that&#x2019;s sentimental, but I mean it &#x2014; to the bitter end.&#x201D; </p>
<p>I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Are you a college man?&#x201D; he inquired suddenly. </p>
<p>For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a &#x201C;gonnegtion,&#x201D; but he only nodded and shook my hand. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead,&#x201D; he suggested. </p>
<p>&#x201C;After that my own rule is to let everything alone.&#x201D; </p>
<p>When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle. </p>
<p>After changing my clothes I went next door and found Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. </p>
<p>His pride in his son and in his son&#x2019;s possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Jimmy sent me this picture.&#x201D; He took out his wallet with trembling fingers. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Look there.&#x201D; </p>
<p>It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands. </p>
<p>He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Look there!&#x201D; and then sought admiration from my eyes. </p>
<p>He had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Jimmy sent it to me. I think it&#x2019;s a very pretty picture. It shows up well.&#x201D; </p>
<p>&#x201C;Very well. Had you seen him lately?&#x201D; </p>
<p>&#x201C;He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now. </p>
<p>Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see now there was a reason for it. </p>
<p>He knew he had a big future in front of him. </p>
<p>And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.&#x201D; </p>
<p>He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. </p>
<p>Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you.&#x201D; </p>
<p>He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. </p>
<p>On the last fly-leaf was printed the word Schedule, and the date September 12, 1906, and underneath: </p>

<p>&#x201C;I come across this book by accident,&#x201D; said the old man. </p>
<p>&#x201C;It just shows you, don&#x2019;t it?&#x201D; </p>
<p>&#x201C;It just shows you.&#x201D; </p>
<p>&#x201C;Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or something. </p>
<p>Do you notice what he&#x2019;s got about improving his mind? </p>
<p>He was always great for that. </p>
<p>He told me I et like a hog once, and I beat him for it.&#x201D; </p>
<p>He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me. </p>
<p>I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use. </p>
<p>A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. </p>
<p>So did Gatsby&#x2019;s father. </p>
<p>And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and he spoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. </p>
<p>The minister glanced several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour. </p>
<p>But it wasn&#x2019;t any use. Nobody came. </p>
<p>About five o&#x2019;clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate &#x2014; </p>
<p>first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman from West Egg in Gatsby&#x2019;s station wagon, all wet to the skin. </p>
<p>As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. </p>
<p>I looked around. </p>
<p>It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby&#x2019;s books in the library one night three months before. </p>
<p>I&#x2019;d never seen him since then. </p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know how he knew about the funeral, or even his name. </p>
<p>The rain poured down his thick glasses, and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby&#x2019;s grave. </p>
<p>I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn&#x2019;t sent a message or a flower. </p>
<p>Dimly I heard someone murmur, &#x201C;Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,&#x201D; and then the owl-eyed man said &#x201C;Amen to that,&#x201D; in a brave voice. </p>
<p>We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. </p>
<p>Owl-eyes spoke to me by the gate. </p>
<p>&#x201C;I couldn&#x2019;t get to the house,&#x201D; he remarked. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Neither could anybody else.&#x201D; </p>
<p>&#x201C;Go on!&#x201D; He started. &#x201C;Why, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds.&#x201D; </p>
<p>He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in. </p>
<p>&#x201C;The poor son-of-a-bitch,&#x201D; he said. </p>
<p>One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. </p>
<p>Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o&#x2019;clock of a December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gayeties, to bid them a hasty good-by. </p>
<p>I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-that&#x2019;s and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: </p>
<p>&#x201C;Are you going to the Ordways&#x2019;? the Herseys&#x2019;? the Schultzes&#x2019;?&#x201D; and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. </p>
<p>And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate. </p>
