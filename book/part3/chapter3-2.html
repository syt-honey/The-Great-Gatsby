                                <p>&#x201C;Do you come to these parties often?&#x201D; inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The last one was the one I met you at,&#x201D; answered the girl, in an alert confident voice.</p>
<p>She turned to her companion: &#x201C;Wasn&#x2019;t it for you, Lucille?&#x201D;</p>
<p>It was for Lucille, too.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I like to come,&#x201D; Lucille said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I never care what I do, so I always have a good time.</p>
<p>When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address &#x2014; inside of a week I got a package from Croirier&#x2019;s with a new evening gown in it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Did you keep it?&#x201D; asked Jordan.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sure I did. I was going to wear it to-night, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered.</p>
<p>It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s something funny about a fellow that&#x2019;ll do a thing like that,&#x201D; said the other girl eagerly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He doesn&#x2019;t want any trouble with anybody.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who doesn&#x2019;t?&#x201D; I inquired.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Gatsby. Somebody told me &#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A thrill passed over all of us.</p>
<p>The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s so much that,&#x201D; argued Lucille sceptically; &#x201C;it&#x2019;s more that he was a German spy during the war.&#x201D;</p>
<p>One of the men nodded in confirmation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,&#x201D; he assured us positively.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, no,&#x201D; said the first girl, &#x201C;it couldn&#x2019;t be that, because he was in the American army during the war.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody&#x2019;s looking at him. I&#x2019;ll bet he killed a man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes and shivered.</p>
<p>Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby.</p>
<p>It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.</p>
<p>The first supper &#x2014; there would be another one after midnight &#x2014; was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden.</p>
<p>There were three married couples and Jordan&#x2019;s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree.</p>
<p>Instead of rambling, this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the country-side &#x2014;</p>
<p>East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s get out,&#x201D; whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is much too polite for me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy.</p>
<p>The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.</p>
<p>The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not there.</p>
<p>She couldn&#x2019;t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn&#x2019;t on the veranda.</p>
<p>On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.</p>
<p>A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books.</p>
<p>As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do you think?&#x201D; he demanded impetuously.</p>
<p>&#x201C;About what?&#x201D; He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.</p>
<p>&#x201C;About that. As a matter of fact you needn&#x2019;t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They&#x2019;re real.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The books?&#x201D; He nodded.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Absolutely real &#x2014; have pages and everything.</p>
<p>I thought they&#x2019;d be a nice durable cardboard.</p>
<p>Matter of fact, they&#x2019;re absolutely real. Pages and &#x2014; Here! Lemme show you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the &#x201C;Stoddard Lectures.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;See!&#x201D; he cried triumphantly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella&#x2019;s a regular Belasco. It&#x2019;s a triumph.</p>
<p>What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too &#x2014; didn&#x2019;t cut the pages.</p>
<p>But what do you want? What do you expect?&#x201D;</p>
<p>He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who brought you?&#x201D; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,&#x201D; he continued.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Has it?&#x201D; &#x201C;A little bit, I think. I can&#x2019;t tell yet. I&#x2019;ve only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books?</p>
<p>They&#x2019;re real. They&#x2019;re &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;You told us.&#x201D; We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.</p>
<p>There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden;</p>
<p>old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners &#x2014;</p>
<p>and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps.</p>
<p>By midnight the hilarity had increased.</p>
<p>A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz,</p>
<p>and between the numbers people were doing &#x201C;stunts&#x201D; all over the garden, while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky.</p>
<p>A pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger-bowls.</p>
<p>The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.</p>
<p>I was still with Jordan Baker.</p>
<p>We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter.</p>
<p>I was enjoying myself now.</p>
<p>I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.</p>
<p>At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Your face is familiar,&#x201D; he said, politely.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Weren&#x2019;t you in the Third Division during the war?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-gun Battalion.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen.</p>
<p>I knew I&#x2019;d seen you somewhere before.&#x201D;</p>
<p>We talked for a moment about some wet, gray little villages in France.</p>
<p>Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What time?&#x201D; &#x201C;Any time that suits you best.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Having a gay time now?&#x201D; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Much better.&#x201D; I turned again to my new acquaintance.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This is an unusual party for me. I haven&#x2019;t even seen the host. I live over there &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, &#x201C;and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m Gatsby,&#x201D; he said suddenly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What!&#x201D; I exclaimed. &#x201C;Oh, I beg your pardon.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I thought you knew, old sport. I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;m not a very good host.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He smiled understandingly &#x2014; much more than understandingly.</p>
<p>It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life.</p>
<p>It faced &#x2014; or seemed to face &#x2014; the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor.</p>
<p>It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself,</p>
<p>and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.</p>
<p>Precisely at that point it vanished &#x2014; and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.</p>
<p>Some time before he introduced himself I&#x2019;d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.</p>
