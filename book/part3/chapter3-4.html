                                <p>A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.</p>
<p>&#x201C;See!&#x201D; he explained. &#x201C;It went in the ditch.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man &#x2014; it was the late patron of Gatsby&#x2019;s library.</p>
<p>&#x201C;How&#x2019;d it happen?&#x201D; He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know nothing whatever about mechanics,&#x201D; he said decisively.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?&#x201D; &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t ask me,&#x201D; said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know very little about driving &#x2014; next to nothing. It happened, and that&#x2019;s all I know.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, if you&#x2019;re a poor driver you oughtn&#x2019;t to try driving at night.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But I wasn&#x2019;t even trying,&#x201D; he explained indignantly, &#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t even trying.&#x201D;</p>
<p>An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do you want to commit suicide?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201D; explained the criminal. &#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t driving. There&#x2019;s another man in the car.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained &#x201C;Ah-h-h!&#x201D; as the door of the coupe swung slowly open.</p>
<p>The crowd &#x2014; it was now a crowd &#x2014; stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause.</p>
<p>Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.</p>
<p>Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Wha&#x2019;s matter?&#x201D; he inquired calmly. &#x201C;Did we run outa gas?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel &#x2014; he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It came off,&#x201D; some one explained. He nodded.</p>
<p>&#x201C;At first I din&#x2019; notice we&#x2019;d stopped.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Wonder&#x2019;ff tell me where there&#x2019;s a gas&#x2019;line station?&#x201D;</p>
<p>At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Back out,&#x201D; he suggested after a moment. &#x201C;Put her in reverse.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But the wheel&#x2019;s off!&#x201D; He hesitated.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No harm in trying,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home.</p>
<p>I glanced back once.</p>
<p>A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby&#x2019;s house, making the night fine as before, and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.</p>
<p>A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.</p>
<p>Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me.</p>
<p>On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.</p>
<p>Most of the time I worked.</p>
<p>In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust.</p>
<p>I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee.</p>
<p>I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.</p>
<p>I took dinner usually at the Yale Club &#x2014; for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day &#x2014; and then I went up-stairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour.</p>
<p>There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work.</p>
<p>After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.</p>
<p>I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night, and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye.</p>
<p>I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness.</p>
<p>At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others &#x2014;</p>
<p>poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner &#x2014; young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.</p>
<p>Again at eight o&#x2019;clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five deep with throbbing taxi-cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart.</p>
<p>Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible 70 gestures inside.</p>
<p>Imagining that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.</p>
<p>For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again.</p>
<p>At first I was flattered to go places with her, because she was a golf champion, and every one knew her name.</p>
<p>Then it was something more. I wasn&#x2019;t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity.</p>
<p>The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something &#x2014; most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don&#x2019;t in the beginning &#x2014; and one day I found what it was.</p>
<p>When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it &#x2014; and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers &#x2014; a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round.</p>
<p>The thing approached the proportions of a scandal &#x2014; then died away.</p>
<p>A caddy retracted his statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken.</p>
<p>The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.</p>
<p>Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible.</p>
<p>She was incurably dishonest.</p>
<p>She wasn&#x2019;t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness,</p>
<p>I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.</p>
<p>It made no difference to me.</p>
<p>Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply &#x2014; I was casually sorry, and then I forgot.</p>
<p>It was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car.</p>
<p>It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man&#x2019;s coat.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re a rotten driver,&#x201D; I protested.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn&#x2019;t to drive at all.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am careful.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, you&#x2019;re not.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, other people are,&#x201D; she said lightly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s that got to do with it?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;They&#x2019;ll keep out of my way,&#x201D; she insisted. &#x201C;It takes two to make an accident.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I hope I never will,&#x201D; she answered. &#x201C;I hate careless people. That&#x2019;s why I like you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Her gray, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her.</p>
<p>But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;d been writing letters once a week and signing them: &#x201C;Love, Nick,&#x201D; and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.</p>
<p>Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.</p>
